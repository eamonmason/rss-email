RSS Email is an AWS Lambda-based serverless application that aggregates RSS feeds, processes articles using Claude AI, and sends curated daily email newsletters. The architecture uses event-driven AWS services with Infrastructure as Code via CDK.

## Quick Start

### Setup and Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Install Node.js dependencies for CDK
npm install
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
uv run python -m pytest tests

# Run specific test file
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_specific_module.py
```

### Linting and Code Quality

```bash
# Run pylint (must score 9.9+ to pass CI)
uv run pylint --fail-under=9.9 $(git ls-files '*.py')

# Run flake8 linting (enforces PEP 8 standards)
uv run flake8

# Run both linting tools together
uv run pylint --fail-under=9.9 $(git ls-files '*.py') && uv run flake8
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality before commits. These hooks match the CI checks and help catch issues early.

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup)
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push

# Run hooks manually on all files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Run hooks on staged files only
uv run pre-commit run
```

**Pre-commit checks include:**

- File quality checks (trailing whitespace, end-of-file, YAML/JSON validation)
- Flake8 linting (PEP 8 compliance)
- Pylint code quality (9.9+ score required)
- Unit tests (on pre-push only)
- CDK synth validation (on pre-push only, for CDK infrastructure changes)

The hooks will automatically fix some issues (trailing whitespace, end-of-file). For other issues, you'll need to fix them manually before committing.

### Local Development

```bash
# Test RSS retrieval locally (outputs to console, doesn't store in S3)
uv run python src/rss_email/retrieve_articles.py <feed_url_json_file>

# Test email formatting locally (doesn't actually send email)
uv run python src/rss_email/email_articles.py

# Test all feeds in feed_urls.json for connectivity
uv run python tests/test_all_feeds.py

# Run CLI article processor for testing Claude integration
uv run python src/cli_article_processor.py
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **retrieve_articles.py**: Key orchestrating Lambda function that fetches RSS feeds and stores aggregated data in S3
- **email_articles.py**: Key orchestrating Lambda function that processes stored articles and sends formatted emails via SES
- **podcast_generator.py**: Lambda function that generates audio podcast versions of the daily news
- **article_processor.py**: Claude AI integration for intelligent article categorization and summarization
- **lib/rss_lambda_stack.ts**: Main CDK infrastructure stack defining all AWS resources
- **cli_article_processor.py**: CLI tool for testing article processing with Claude API locally
- **compression_utils.py**: Utilities for compressing/decompressing article data for S3 storage
- **json_repair.py**: JSON repair utilities for handling malformed API responses

### Data Flow
1. **retrieve_articles.py** orchestrates RSS feed processing: fetches articles from feeds configured in `feed_urls.json`, creates aggregated file of recent articles, and stores in S3
2. **email_articles.py** orchestrates email delivery: retrieves aggregated articles from S3, processes them through Claude API for categorization (Technology, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, etc.), formats into HTML email, and sends via SES
3. **podcast_generator.py** (optional) creates audio podcast: generates conversational script using Claude, synthesizes speech with two distinct voices using AWS Polly, and publishes to podcast RSS feed
4. Error handling and logging via SNS and CloudWatch with automated alerts

### AWS Services Used
- **Lambda**: Serverless execution
- **S3**: Storage for RSS data, configuration, and podcast audio files
- **SES**: Email sending and receiving
- **SNS**: Error notifications
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
- **EventBridge**: Scheduled triggers for Lambda functions
- **Polly**: Text-to-speech for podcast generation
- **Parameter Store**: Environment configuration

### Scheduling

The system runs on the following schedule (all times in UTC):

- **RSS Retrieval**: Every 3 hours (`0 */3 * * *`) - Fetches latest articles from configured RSS feeds
- **Email Delivery**: 7:30 AM, Monday-Friday (`30 7 * * 2-6`) - Sends daily digest email
- **Podcast Generation**: 8:00 AM, Monday-Friday (`0 8 * * 2-6`) - Creates audio podcast (runs 30 minutes after email)

**Manual Triggering:**

You can manually trigger any Lambda function using the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Trigger RSS retrieval
aws lambda invoke --function-name <RSSGenerationFunction-name> output.json

# Trigger email sending
aws lambda invoke --function-name <RSSEmailerFunction-name> output.json

# Trigger podcast generation
aws lambda invoke --function-name <RSSPodcastFunction-name> output.json
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the base directory of the project, for your custom settings:

```sh
SOURCE_DOMAIN="mydomain.com"
SOURCE_EMAIL_ADDRESS="rss@mydomain"
TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS="me@someemailprovider.com"
EMAIL_RECIPIENTS="morerssplease@onedomain.com,sendmerss@twodomain.com"
```

### Required Environment Variables
- `SOURCE_DOMAIN`: Email sending domain (must be verified in SES)
- `SOURCE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: From email address
- `TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Primary recipient email
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`: Comma-separated list of recipient emails
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` & `AWS_REGION`: AWS deployment configuration

### Feed Configuration
RSS sources are configured in `feed_urls.json` with this structure:
```json
{
  "feeds": [
    {
      "name": "Feed Name",
      "url": "https://example.com/feed.xml"
    }
  ]
}
```

### CDK Pre-requisites

If you have not run CDK in the target account and region, then bootstrap the CDK deploy by running:

```sh
cdk bootstrap aws://<your-account-id>/<target-region>
```

### Setting up Email

You need a domain for sending and (possibly) receiving email. I use route53, but any domain hosting will work as long as you have the ability to edit domain records for SES.

#### Sending Emails

SES needs a verified domain for sending emails from a trusted domain, and a verified email address for whoever you send the email to. See: [https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=eu-west-1#/verified-identities/create](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=eu-west-1#/verified-identities/create) for setup instructions.

If your domain is registered in route53 then this happens automatically in a few minutes.

#### Receiving Emails

Create an MX record in your domain that points to the appropriate inbound SMTP relay for the region that the application is deployed in. See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-mx-record.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-mx-record.html)

## Claude Integration

The RSS Email system integrates with Anthropic's Claude API to provide intelligent categorization, summarization, and grouping of RSS articles.

### Features

#### Intelligent Categorization

Articles are categorized into the following categories (in priority order):
1. Technology, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Programming, Science
2. Business, Politics, Health, Environment
3. Entertainment, Gaming, Cycling, Media/TV/Film
4. Other

#### Article Summaries

Each article receives a 2-3 sentence summary that captures the key information while being concise enough for quick scanning.

#### Related Article Grouping

Similar articles covering the same topic or event are identified and grouped together, reducing redundancy in the email.

#### Enhanced Email Template

The enhanced email template features:
- Category-based sections with distinct styling
- Collapsible article descriptions (show more/less functionality)
- Related article indicators
- Metadata showing generation time and article counts
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured in the CDK stack:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PARAMETER`: Name of the AWS Parameter Store parameter containing the API key (default: `rss-email-anthropic-api-key`)
- `CLAUDE_MODEL`: The Claude model to use (default: `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`)
- `CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum tokens per request (default: `100000`)
- `CLAUDE_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum API requests per Lambda execution (default: `5`)
- `CLAUDE_ENABLED`: Feature flag to enable/disable Claude processing (default: `true`)

#### AWS Parameter Store

Before deploying, you need to create a parameter in AWS Parameter Store:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "rss-email-anthropic-api-key" \
    --value "your-anthropic-api-key" \
    --type "SecureString" \
    --description "Anthropic API key for RSS email categorization"
```

### Error Handling and Fallback

The system includes robust error handling:
- If Claude API fails, the system falls back to the original HTML generation
- All errors are logged to CloudWatch
- API usage is monitored and limited to prevent excessive costs

### Monitoring

The integration logs the following metrics to CloudWatch:
- API usage (tokens consumed)
- Processing time
- Success/failure rates
- Fallback activations

### Cost Considerations

- The system uses Claude 3 Haiku for cost efficiency
- Token usage is limited per request and per Lambda execution
- Only new articles since the last run are processed

### Disabling Claude Integration

To disable Claude integration and revert to the original behavior:
1. Set the `CLAUDE_ENABLED` environment variable to `false` in the Lambda configuration
2. Or remove the Anthropic API key from Parameter Store

The system will automatically fall back to the original HTML generation.

## Podcast Generation

The RSS Email system includes an optional podcast generation feature that creates audio versions of the daily news digest using Claude AI and AWS Polly.

### Features

#### Two-Host Conversational Format

- Podcast features two distinct AI hosts: **Marco** (enthusiastic, detail-oriented) and **John** (analytical, asks clarifying questions)
- Natural dialogue format makes technical news more engaging and accessible
- Hosts discuss stories, provide context, and offer insights

#### Intelligent Script Generation

- Claude AI generates 5-10 minute podcast scripts from the day's articles
- Content is organized by theme (AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Business, etc.)
- Technical concepts are explained in accessible terms
- Scripts prioritize high-impact stories and connect related topics

#### High-Quality Audio Synthesis

- AWS Polly Neural voices provide natural-sounding speech
- Marco uses "Matthew" voice (US English, conversational)
- John uses "Joey" voice (US English, analytical)
- Automatic text chunking handles scripts of any length (bypasses Polly's 3000-char limit)

#### Podcast RSS Feed

- Standard podcast RSS 2.0 feed with iTunes tags
- Compatible with all major podcast apps (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.)
- Feed URL: `https://{your-bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com/podcasts/feed.xml`
- Maintains history of last 10 episodes

```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

The podcast function uses these environment variables (configured in CDK):

- `BUCKET`: S3 bucket for storing podcast audio files
- `KEY`: S3 key for the aggregated RSS feed file
- `PODCAST_LAST_RUN_PARAMETER`: SSM parameter name for tracking last run (default: `rss-podcast-lastrun`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PARAMETER`: SSM parameter containing the Anthropic API key
- `CLAUDE_MODEL`: Claude model to use for script generation (default: `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`)
- `CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum tokens for script generation (default: `4000`)

#### IAM Permissions

The podcast Lambda function requires:

- **S3**: Read access to RSS feed, write access to `podcasts/` prefix
- **Polly**: `polly:SynthesizeSpeech` permission
- **SSM**: Read/write access to the last run parameter

### Cost Analysis

Daily cost estimate for 1 podcast per day:

| Service | Usage | Unit Cost | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Lambda | 10 min × 128 MB | $0.0000166667/GB-sec | $0.0013 | $0.04 |
| Claude API | ~2,000 tokens | $0.25-$1.00/M tokens | $0.0005-$0.002 | $0.015-$0.06 |
| AWS Polly (Neural) | ~8,000 chars | $16/M chars | $0.128 | $3.84 |
| S3 Storage | 8 MB/day = 240 MB/mo | $0.023/GB | $0.0001 | $0.006 |
| **Total** | | | **~$0.13** | **~$3.95** |

**Cost Optimization Tips:**

- Polly Neural voices account for ~87% of costs
- Consider Standard voices (75% cheaper) for lower cost at slightly reduced quality
- Audio files stored in S3 indefinitely (minimal cost)
- No charges for RSS feed downloads from S3

### Usage

#### Subscribing to the Podcast

Once deployed, subscribe to the podcast feed using the URL:

```
https://{your-bucket-name}.s3.amazonaws.com/podcasts/feed.xml
```

Add this URL to your podcast app:

- **Apple Podcasts**: Library → Edit → Add a Show by URL
- **Spotify**: Not supported for custom RSS feeds (requires Spotify for Podcasters)
- **Pocket Casts**: Discover → Search → Enter feed URL
- **Overcast**: + → Add URL

#### Trigger

The podcast generation Lambda is triggered by the same SNS topic as the email function, so podcasts are generated automatically when new articles are retrieved.

### Monitoring

CloudWatch logs include:

- Script generation success/failure
- Script length (character count)
- Number of speaker segments detected
- Number of audio chunks synthesized
- S3 upload status
- RSS feed update status

### Troubleshooting

**No audio generated:**

- Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- Verify Polly permissions in IAM role
- Ensure Claude API key is valid in SSM Parameter Store

**Podcast feed not updating:**

- Check S3 permissions for writing to `podcasts/feed.xml`
- Verify feed URL is accessible (S3 bucket policy may need public read access)
- Check CloudWatch logs for XML generation errors

**Audio quality issues:**

- Neural voices provide best quality but cost more
- Standard voices are 75% cheaper with slightly robotic sound
- Voice selection is configurable in `podcast_generator.py` constants

### Disabling Podcast Generation

To disable podcast generation:

1. Remove the SNS subscription for the podcast Lambda function
2. Or delete the `RSSPodcastFunction` from the CDK stack

The email functionality will continue to work independently.

## Deployment

### Deploy the Stack

Deploy the stack with CDK by running:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

### CDK Operations

```bash
# Synthesize CDK stack
npx cdk synth

# Deploy main application stack
cdk deploy

# Deploy pipeline stack
cdk deploy --app "npx ts-node bin/pipeline-cdk.ts"

# View deployment differences
cdk diff
```

### Pipeline Deployment

Add a GitHub personal token to AWS Secrets Manager, for the github repo, called `github-token`.

Put the following environment variables in parameter store, with appropriate values (as described above with the `.env` file):

- `rss-email-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `rss-email-AWS_REGION`
- `rss-email-EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`
- `rss-email-SOURCE_DOMAIN`
- `rss-email-SOURCE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`
- `rss-email-TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Deploy the pipeline itself:

```sh
cdk deploy --app "npx ts-node bin/pipeline-cdk.ts"
```

Once the deploy has completed successfully, upload the `feed_urls.json` file to the new S3 bucket, for example:

```json
{
    "feeds": [
        {
            "name": "Krebs on Security",
            "url": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/"
        },
        {
            "name": "The Register",
            "url": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/data_centre/cloud/headlines.atom"
        }
    ]
}
```

See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html#cdk_pipeline_security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html#cdk_pipeline_security) for more info.

#### Pipeline Parameters
Store these values in AWS Parameter Store with `rss-email-` prefix:
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AWS_REGION`
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`, `SOURCE_DOMAIN`, `SOURCE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

## Post-deployment

To receive email correctly, post deployment the SES Active Rule Set has to be enabled. Go to "Email receiving", select the RSSRuleSet resource and click "Set as Active".

Post-deployment, the SES Rule Set must be manually activated in the AWS console.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests in `/tests/` directory cover all core modules:
- Tests use `moto` for AWS service mocking
- Integration tests validate RSS feed processing and email formatting
- CI runs tests against Python 3.13
- Pylint enforces code quality with 9.9+ score requirement
- All Python code must conform to PEP 8 standards (enforced by flake8)

### Claude Integration Testing

#### Comprehensive Test Suite

A comprehensive test script `test_article_processor.py` is provided to test all aspects of the Claude integration:

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_article_processor.py

# Run specific tests
python test_article_processor.py rate_limiter  # Test rate limiting
python test_article_processor.py tokens        # Test token estimation
python test_article_processor.py prompt        # Test prompt creation
python test_article_processor.py api_key       # Test API key retrieval
python test_article_processor.py claude        # Test Claude processing
python test_article_processor.py fallback      # Test fallback behavior
```

The test suite includes:
- **Rate Limiter Tests**: Verifies token and request limiting
- **Token Estimation Tests**: Validates token counting logic
- **Prompt Creation Tests**: Ensures prompts are correctly formatted
- **API Key Retrieval Tests**: Tests Parameter Store integration
- **Claude Processing Tests**: Full integration test with Claude API
- **Fallback Tests**: Verifies graceful degradation

#### Manual Testing

To test the email generation locally:

1. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PARAMETER="rss-email-anthropic-api-key"
export CLAUDE_ENABLED="true"
export CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
```

2. Run the email generation:
```bash
python src/rss_email/email_articles.py bucket-name rss.xml --local-file test-rss.xml
```

#### Testing Without AWS

For local testing without AWS credentials, you can:

1. Set the API key directly:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

2. Modify the test script to use the direct API key instead of Parameter Store

## Functional Testing

### Overview

The `test_functional_workflow.py` script provides a comprehensive end-to-end test of the RSS email workflow. This test simulates the complete production workflow locally without sending actual emails.

### What the Test Does

1. **Sets SSM Parameter**: Updates the `rss-email-lastrun` parameter to 24 hours ago
2. **Downloads RSS Data**: Fetches the current RSS articles from the production S3 bucket
3. **Generates Email**: Runs the complete email generation workflow including Claude processing (if configured)
4. **Outputs HTML**: Writes the result to a local HTML file instead of sending an email
5. **Cleanup**: Restores the original SSM parameter and cleans up temporary files

### Prerequisites

#### AWS Credentials
You need AWS credentials configured for the target account. This can be done via:
- AWS CLI profile: `aws configure`
- Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- IAM instance role (if running on EC2)

#### Required AWS Permissions
The test requires the following AWS permissions:
- `ssm:GetParameter` - Read SSM parameters
- `ssm:PutParameter` - Update SSM parameters
- `ssm:DeleteParameter` - Clean up test parameters
- `s3:GetObject` - Download RSS files from S3

#### Environment Variables
Set the AWS region:
```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1  # or your target region
```

#### Optional: Claude Configuration

**Method 1: Using .env file (Recommended for local testing)**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# Copy the example file and edit it
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API key
```

**Method 2: Environment variables**
```bash
export CLAUDE_ENABLED=true
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
export CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

**Method 3: AWS Parameter Store (Production)**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PARAMETER=rss-email-anthropic-api-key
# Store the actual API key in AWS Parameter Store under this name
```

### Running the Test

#### Basic Usage

**Quick Test (Recommended)**
```bash
# Fast mode with limited articles for quicker Claude testing
FAST_MODE=true uv run python test_functional_workflow.py

# Or set environment variables in .env file:
# FAST_MODE=true
# MAX_TEST_ARTICLES=10
uv run python test_functional_workflow.py
```

**Full Test**
```bash
# Process all articles (may take 2-3 minutes with Claude)
uv run python test_functional_workflow.py

# Or run directly (requires dependencies installed)
python test_functional_workflow.py
```

#### Expected Output

#### Output Files

The test generates:
- `functional_test_output.html` - The generated email HTML (can be opened in a browser)
- `downloaded_rss.xml` - Temporarily downloaded RSS file (cleaned up automatically)

### Configuration Options

You can modify the test configuration by editing these variables in the script:

```python
class FunctionalWorkflowTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ssm_parameter_name = "rss-email-lastrun"
        self.s3_bucket = "cd-rssemailstack-rssbucket91adb797-1ds7r89g7wdoo"
        self.s3_key = "rss.xml"
        self.output_file = "functional_test_output.html"
        self.downloaded_rss_file = "downloaded_rss.xml"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**AWS Credentials Error**
```
NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials
```
Solution: Configure AWS credentials using `aws configure` or set environment variables.

**Permission Denied**
```
AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/test is not authorized
```
Solution: Ensure your AWS user/role has the required permissions listed above.

**S3 Bucket Not Found**
```
NoSuchBucket: The specified bucket does not exist
```
Solution: Verify the S3 bucket name in the script matches your deployment.

**SSM Parameter Issues**
```
ParameterNotFound: Parameter rss-email-lastrun not found
```
This is normal - the test will create the parameter if it doesn't exist.

#### Debugging

Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
python -c "
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
exec(open('test_functional_workflow.py').read())
"
```

#### Manual Cleanup

If the test fails and doesn't clean up properly:

```bash
# Remove test files
rm -f functional_test_output.html downloaded_rss.xml

# Reset SSM parameter (replace with your original value)
aws ssm put-parameter --name "rss-email-lastrun" --value "2025-07-02T08:30:33.811000" --type String --overwrite
```

### Integration with CI/CD

The test can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
uv run python test_functional_workflow.py
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Functional test passed"
else
    echo "Functional test failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Comparison with Unit Tests

| Feature | Unit Tests | Functional Test |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Scope | Individual functions | End-to-end workflow |
| Dependencies | Mocked | Real AWS services |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Reliability | High | Dependent on AWS |
| Coverage | Code paths | User scenarios |

Use this functional test to:
- Verify deployment health
- Test configuration changes
- Validate AWS permissions
- Debug production issues
- Demonstrate the complete workflow

For development and quick feedback, continue using the unit tests in the `tests/` directory.

## Development Workflow

When making changes to Python code, always follow this workflow:

1. **Make your changes** to the Python code
2. **Run unit tests** to ensure functionality: `uv run python -m pytest tests`
3. **Run linting** to ensure code quality: `uv run pylint --fail-under=9.9 $(git ls-files '*.py') && uv run flake8`
4. **Update documentation** if the changes affect public APIs or functionality
5. **Ensure PEP compliance** - flake8 will catch most PEP 8 violations automatically

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests in `/tests/` directory cover all core modules
- Tests use `moto` for AWS service mocking
- Integration tests validate RSS feed processing and email formatting
- CI runs tests against Python 3.13
- Pylint enforces code quality with 9.9+ score requirement
- All Python code must conform to PEP 8 standards (enforced by flake8)
